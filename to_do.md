# TO DO 

1. Update models so the base models being with Base_ and the models that are used in the app start with the app

2. this way can add in logic to places like the base template where we display the models and do not want to display the base models, but can still display the app models for the other things. this is because we do not want to display base models like users and permissions there, that should be in the admin section only.
